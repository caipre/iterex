Saturday Sam and I did another hike, this time in the Rio Chillar. It was a walk
in a shallow river through an old mine and in the valley between mountains. In
some parts the walls narrowed so the river's current picked up. It was a lot of
fun walking through the water the whole way, and seemed to go on and on. We
walked about two hours before stopping for lunch, and Sam said there was still
more that we hadn't made it to. While resting on a rocky ledge, we passed the
time playing target practice by throwing small rocks at larger ones, knocking
them over the edge and down the slope into the water. Simple joys!

On Monday Sam, Eli and I visited Alhambra, a castle that was the last Muslim
holdout in Spain during the Middle Ages. We walked through the ruins of old
homes, on top of walls and towers, and around the large gardens. I love seeing
historical places like that and imagining the lives of those people, hundreds
and hundreds of years ago.

On the way back to Nerja, we followed a small road through the mountains that
offered some incredible views. After winding around for about an hour, we
reached Otivar hungry for lunch. Unfortunately, Spain pretty much closes shop in
the afternoon for the *mediodia*, and the chefs at the four restaurants we tried
were all taking their siestas. We finally made it back to Nerja about 7:00 in
the evening had a nice dinner at a local restaurant named Trillizos.
