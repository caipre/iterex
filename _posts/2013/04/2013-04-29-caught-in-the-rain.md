title: Caught in the rain
---
As the forecast had predicted, it was raining Sunday morning when we wanted to
leave. We waited around from room to room, hoping the weather would clear up. It
wasn't until mid-afternoon that the rain finally stopped. We were eager to get
back on the road and decided to get a few hours in even though the sky was still
cloudy. Here was our first ride of the *real* tour; the road ahead was ours for
the taking. We had a route in mind, but were willingly keeping it flexible.
Part of the joy of travel is adapting to the unexpected.

It wasn't long before it started raining again. The skies had never hidden their
intent so we already wearing our rain gear and continued riding. The trouble
with cities like Cartagena is that their whole surrounding area is developed.
As we rode out through the suburbs, the rain kept on falling and night began to
settle in. We started to realize that the storm wasn't going to pass as quickly
as we had expected and that we weren't going to find a good site to camp. The
few fields in the area were olive groves that lacked cover and were quickly
filling thick with mud.

After several kilometers of searching, we were finally desperate enough to set
up camp in plain sight. Soaked to the bone, we turned down the entrance of a
farm and parked ourselves on a concrete slab beside a locked gate. In pouring
rain and with numb fingers we hurriedly tried to set up the tent. The rainfly
caught small pools of water that formed a network of rivers, each running down
into the tent itself. Once finally set up, the tent and the two of us all stood
wet and shivering. Our shelter was saturated and we both knew that we couldn't
put anything inside. It was our first night of the real trip, and this was a
reality check. We waited, unsure of what to do next.

After a few minutes, the rain eased up and eventually stopped. We grabbed a few
hand towels intended for cleaning the bikes and dried the interior of the tent
as best we could. Then we moved our bags under the rainfly and settled ourselves
inside. The rain soon came down again and continued overnight but there were
always periods where it was lighter. We had learned a hard lesson: let the rain
pass before setting up camp. A wet shelter is hardly shelter at all.

We were lucky &mdash; next morning, the sun was bright and warmed and dried us.
Some people arrived to work on the farm, but none seemed to care that we were
there or that we were hanging our socks and jackets on the gate to dry. It would
have been a perfect day to start the trip.
