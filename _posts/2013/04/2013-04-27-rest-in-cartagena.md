title: Rest in Cartagena
---
We've spent the past few days with Sam's grandparents in Cartagena, enjoying the
comforts of home cooked meals, soft beds, and warm showers. From the moment we
entered, Sam's abuela has been cooking up great food for us. She won't let us go
any place hungry and has made sure that we have seconds at each meal and snacks
throughout the day. We've had Spanish tortilla (like an egg omelette with slices
of potatoes and onions), breaded chicken, Cocido soup (chickpeas, vegetables,
potatoes, and chicken), Dorada with baked potatoes, baked lamb, bizcocho (like
lemon pound cake), and arroz con leche (rice in a vanilla pudding).

I don't normally seek out seafood, but this was delicious. Sam agrees:

Though she must be in her eighties, abuela seems strong as ever. She walked with
us for several blocks to a morning market, pushing a cartful of potatoes and
fruit on the way home. While we've been resting from the ride and anticipating
the rest of the trip, she has managed to finish a hundred different daily chores
and take care of us. It's humbling, really. She only speaks Spanish, and an
older form at that, and I've enjoyed listening to her lively conversations with
Samu and our own faltering attempts. Language is interesting.

We spent half a day exploring Cartagena; Sam showed me around the sights he
remembered visiting years back. The city dates back to Roman times and we looked
out over the ruins of an old plaza and amphitheatre. We also spent some time
wandering around the commercial streets downtown and enjoyed churros hot from
the oven that we dipped in a cup of super rich chocolate.

The break has also afforded us some time to connect with family back home and
to revisit our plans for the route the trip will follow. Our original thought
was to head from Spain straight up into France and the UK, but instead we'll
take a more winding path to visit many of the countries in Western Europe. It
will be an interesting balance of pace to keep on schedule.

We're planning to set off again tomorrow, but that will depend on the weather.
While out walking yesterday we got caught in a **heavy** rain that drenched us
and turned the streets into rivers; the forecast for the next few days shows
more rain and wind, which together make the worst possible conditions for
biking. Given our time constraints though, we can't wait for too long, and I
really hope the forecast is wrong.
