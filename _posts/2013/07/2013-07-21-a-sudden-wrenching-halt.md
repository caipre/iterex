title: A Sudden Wrenching Halt
---
Sometime between 3:00 and 10:00 this morning our bikes were stolen. We suspect
someone jumped the fence surrounding the back patio where we'd stored them for
the night. The gate had been locked. Noone heard or saw anything. Today the
bikes are nowhere. They're not where we left them; they've not been moved
someplace out of the way; they're not going to appear again if we turn around
expectantly. They're completely absent. They're gone.

And so our trip has come to a sudden, wrenching halt.
