One month and a handful of countries later, how about a quick update!

We've made our way into Great Britain by way of a ferry from Hoek von Holland to
Harwich. We had planned to go through Denmark to Esjberg, but the next available
ferry was past my Visa deadline and cost some 600 euros. Since passing out of
the Schengen zone, it's been two days' easy riding toward Cambridge, where we've
spent the better part of the afternoon exploring the many colleges. At the
moment, I've just finished a pint of the local ale at the Kingston Arms pub just
outside the center.

In mainland Europe we had just three months to cover some 4,500 kilometers
through half a dozen countries. Now that we're in the UK, we have nearly the
same amount of time (two months) to cover a much smaller area. We're not
thinking too far ahead so as to let each day decide itself.

Tonight? 20km to camping. Tomorrow? ... north?
