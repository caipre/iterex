Without the bikes, this trip has taken a rather massive turn. Sam and I stuck in Durham for the weekend while letting the consequences sink in.  We were fortunate to be in good company: thank you Alastair and Gilly for hosting us during a difficult few days. It was a privilege to have met you both.

Sam has decided to return home. Since I had pre-purchased my flight home I'll be continuing on, alone, in a rented Skoda Citigo ("Car of the year!"). I must admit that this is one of the most difficult challenges I've ever faced. There's the immediate difficulty of driving a left-hand manual in a right-hand drive on the left side of the road. Then there's the change from covering 60 miles per day by bike to driving 60 miles *per hour* in a car. I have a lot more time to fill. But far more difficult than these is knowing that I'm going ahead on my own. I can't express the heaviness I've felt since stepping into the car and driving away from the last people I know in this country. This isn't a vacation. Travel is **hard**.

Gilly, I've listened to the album five or six times now. It means so much to me.

Press on! *Into the Wild*.
