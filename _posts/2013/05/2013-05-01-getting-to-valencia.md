title: Riding to Valencia and a bus to Barcelona
---
## Cartagena to San Javier, then to Alicante and San Juan
We left Cartagena late afternoon on Sunday but were only able to ride for an
hour or so before the rain forced us to camp. We dried our gear the next
morning and shared one of the two Spanish tortillas abuela had demanded we take
with us. Then we started riding again, back along the N340. We stopped in
Torrevieja for lunch on the beach (just the usual bocadillo). A few hours riding
brought us to Alicante, where we rested for just a bit in a park. It was a
larger city with a lot of traffic and as we navigated our way out we were
flanked by fast moving buses and cars, making for unfriendly riding. We made it
to San Juan where we found a comfortable campsite a short way from a walking
trail.

## San Juan to Jávea
For breakfast, we shared the second Spanish tortilla abuela had given us. Then
it was a *steep* ride down and back up and out of a small community of homes
stacked along the coast. The early climb put our legs in gear, and for a while
it was quick riding. We stopped for a snack at another beach in Altea, then
continued along rolling coastal hills. As we rode, the road became busy with
traffic and began to leave the coast so we turned off onto a smaller road toward
Teulada. While we were nearing the town, storm clouds rolled in and the sky
turned dark. We ducked into a restaurant for lunch and to avoid getting caught
in the rain a second time. A few hours passed with no rain and the sky cleared
up; we decided it was safe to head out again. Leaving town, the road turned
downhill and presented us with a great view of a lone mountain in the distance.
We passed through Jávea in the early evening and started to climb a large hill
on the other side of the city. Near the top, we set up camp by the ruins of an
old mill.

## Jávea/Denia to Valencia
From our campsite it was a only a bit further uphill then a long and twisted
descent into neighboring Denia. We'd definitely had the easier side to climb.
The road levelled out and we pushed forward at 30km/h along a well marked bike
path; this was the easiest riding of the trip so far. We took short breaks in
Gandia and Cullera then kept riding toward Valencia. By late afternoon we
arrived and rode through the immense Ciudad de las Sciencias and the large park
that separates the city in half. We made our way to the bus terminal where we
bought a pair of tickets to Barcelona &mdash; the time constraints of the
Schengen Agreement meant we'd need to use some other methods of travel to
complete our route. Tickets in hand and with the sun setting, we rode a few
kilometers back out of the city and set up camp in some trees just a few meters
from a walking path. It wasn't a good site, but we didn't want to pay for a
campground since we would be staying with friends the next day in Barcelona.
With an alarm set for 5 AM, we went to sleep; nearby a few late-nighters passed
by, walking their dogs and (hopefully) not noticing the tent and bikes in the
trees.

## Valencia
Our bus to Barcelona left at 1 in the afternoon, but we wanted to explore
Valencia for the short while we were there. We also wanted to get our tent
packed up before anyone saw us, so it was early in the morning when we woke up
and rode out (skipping breakfast). As the sun peeked out over the horizon, we
followed a bike path along the beach toward the city. Once or twice we stalled
out in sand that had blown over the path. Back in the city, we explored the
Ciudad de las Sciencas again while noone else was around.

Then decided it was time for breakfast. We got a recommendation from a city
park worker and managed to find "El Trobador" after a bit of searching. After a
coffee and slice of quiche, we set out to wander the city. We visited the city
hall and the plaza del toros (bullfighting arena), then made our way again to
the central park to clean our bikes before the bus ride. The driver was friendly
and at 1:00, we were on our way to Barcelona.

## Barcelona and Sitges
After just four hours (the trip would have taken four days for us), we arrived
at the Barcelona bus terminal. We rode a short distance to the train station and
caught a train to Sitges, a nearby city where some family friends lived. Ximo
and Gudy welcomed us into their home.
