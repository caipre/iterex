title: Two Ferries to Italy
---
After a day of exploring Marseille, we left France on a ship to Italy. In my
mind I had pictured the ferry to be something like the fishing boat from the
movie *A Perfect Storm*; instead, we boarded something like a cruise ship,
complete with several upper decks, two pools, and four restuarants. It was an
order of magnitude larger than any ship I'd ever been on, and I grinned from ear
to ear exploring it, imagining myself running through the Titanic.

After twelve hours sailing (an overnight trip), we arrived in [Bastia][1],
Corsica, a small city on a small island between France and Italy. We had a few
hours to explore before a second ferry carried us the rest of the trip to
[Livorno][2] in Italy. We arrived in time to grab groceries for dinner and head
out of the city to look for a campsite.

So long France! Into the Italian peninsula our adventure continues.
