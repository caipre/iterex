title: Driving Around England: The First Ten Days
---
 Leaving Durham, I drove toward Sunderland some 20miles away. On the bikes the trip would have taken two hours; with the car it was no more than a half hour. I hadn't expected to arrive so early and found myself with a whole evening to kill. I spent the first night parked next to the harbor, reading my guidebook and wrestling with loneliness and apprehension.

On advice from Gilly and Alastair, I had planned to follow the eastern coastline north into Scotland. That plan changed when I heard that Phil, my brother-in-law (to be), wanted to fly out to visit me for a few days. I had a week before his arrival so I decided I would head southward into central England, leaving Scotland for us to explore together.

I spent the second day around Sunderland, the highlight of which was a visit to the National Glass Center. I was able to catch a glass blowing demonstration, which was great.

When the glass is taken out of the furnace it has the consistency of honey &mdash; the instructor held the blowing stick steady and the molten glass at the end drooped down then fell to the table in a glob. Meanwhile it rapidly cooled, and the filaments that stretched back to the stick hardened into many firm but fragile (and probably dangerous), fishing-line thin spindles of "glass spaghetti." The museum was excellent and had cost nothing, so I bought two marbles to contribute back.

After the museum I wandered around Roker beach and the nearby coastline, alternatively going on short walks and sitting to read. In the evening I drove south along the coast, eventually finding a quiet parking space in a nature reserve near Blackhall Rocks. Well it looked quiet anyway; a woman drove in late at night to walk her dogs and I felt compelled to introduce myself and explain why I was eating soup from a can with a sleeping bag in the seat next to me. She was good humored and wished me well. That night the sky was dark, and with no lights around I slept soundly until another dog woke me up early the next morning.

Most of the next day was uneventful. I visited the marina in Hartlepool, which turned out to be an industrial city without much to see. I did sample England's favorite food, fish and chips, and it was probably the most unhealthy meal I've ever had. I left the city and decided to head for the national parks; I had thought about going to Leeds, but driving in unfamiliar cities isn't fun: no (free) parking and no time to navigate.

I headed into North York Moors National Park and found a hiking trail. I climbed to the summit and looked across a gorgeous landscape fit below a fine sunset. Somehow my loneliness faded in the face of that hike; resting on the edge of some rocks called The Wainstones, I didn't mind being alone. I walked back to the car and drove a short way to the larger lot I had noticed earlier. I backed in and prepared for another night sleeping in the car.

Before long, a group of people showed up taking photos. I offered to take a group shot for them, and they noticed my lack of accent. I found myself explaining again why I was sleeping in a car and my plans to head into the parks for some hiking. "Trouble is," I said, "Sam kept the tent, so I'm waiting for him to send mine over before I do any real hikes." The group left, and I had the lot to myself for the night. Next morning I woke early again and found a bag left by my car and filled with snacks, a thermos of coffee, CDs for the car, and a tent! Thank you John, Kathryn, Laura, Kathleen, and Alyssa. I was happy enough just having met you guys, this was more than I could have asked for.

That day I continued further into the national park, stopping for a bit in Helmsley before heading north again toward Whitby. I was taking a zigzag route, but distance was no longer a constraint. The drive was through high rolling hills and along tight roads. I spent most of the day in third gear, navigating sharp corners up and down steep climbs and gripping the wheel as each oncoming car squeezed next to mine with inches between us and the stone walls lining the roadside. I'd come quite a ways from when I picked up the rental car and had trouble getting into gear (turns out that everything is mirrored in the car except the transmission itself; first gear is still up and to the left, and it's really hard to start a car in fifth gear!) I stopped often to take photos, even having fun with the shots more than just snapping a landscape (unfortunately I can't show these until I get home and have my computer). I visited Whitby and later Scarborough, both of which turned out to be mostly tourist traps. I kept to the less crowded areas and tried to take in the sights while ignoring the ice cream stands next to the 13th century ruins. I left the city after dark, and drove toward Peak District National Park.

*Aside: Without a computer I can't upload photos from my camera. I'm working on making a habit of taking photos with the iPod was well, since I can put those up. You'll just have to imagine these sections...*

Before long it started to rain. About two hours in I missed a turn in one of the pass-through towns and pulled into an apartment parking lot behind another car to reorient. As I was looking at the map another car parked behind me, a bit too close for comfort. It was late and I was tired, so I decided to wait until morning before maneuvering out, figuring it would be light out and the rain might stop. It wasn't pretty, but next morning I managed to get out without bumping either car (no small accomplishment given my experience!)

Somewhat unintentionally, I was driving through the area Sam and I had biked through a week or so before.  In the area but too far off our route was the National Coal Museum; I didn't miss it on my second pass through the region. The museum itself was small, but the main feature was a guided tour in a real mine. Chris, the guide, was a retired miner, and spoke with an accent as rich as the "coil" (coal) itself. The tour was excellent, in spite of the fact that I only understood three of every five words owing to the mix of mining terminology and the local accents.

Afterwards I made my way into the Peak District, where pouring rains kept me holed up in the car. During a break in the weather I ventured out on a short walk, cut even shorter by the returning storm clouds. After a quick nap and a while watching the rain fall, I decided to move on. I drove south through towns like Tideswell and Hulme End, still driving in the park to at least see it through the window. Late at night I found a remote spot to park as the rain continued to come down.

Next morning I switched direction and turned back north, heading toward Lake District National Park. I was feeling more confident with the car and decided to drive the "Highwayman Road," famous in England for being both scenic and dangerous (seventh most dangerous road in the country). I didn't find it to be any more risky than the others I'd driven (not necessarily a good thing). I passed around Manchester, enduring heavy rainfall that flooded some sections of the road. When I finally reached the park I found it to be overrun by tourists; traffic was stop and go on the main road, and families scurried around the towns. I checked the map and made my way to a smaller road, eventually finding a trailhead with free parking and no one else around. The weather had turned for the better, so I loaded some things into the hiking pack Alastair had given me and set off toward the summit. I reached the peak after a few miles and once again took in the sunset from atop a mountain. After a rest I hiked down a little ways and, entering the pine trees beside the trail, set up camp on the most level spot I could find (it wasn't so level). There was a bit of rain overnight, but thanks to my new tent I stayed dry and enjoyed the outing.

I hiked back to the car the next morning, pleased at having managed my first solo overnight camp without issue. With just two days until Phil arrived in Glasgow, I made my way out of the park, still sticking to the lesser roads. I managed my way through the Wrynose Pass, a section a *incredibly* steep road (grades at 25%,  some of the steepest in the country) that put me in first gear for most of the climb. Completing the pass was enough for me and I went back to the highway as I made my way toward Hadrian's Wall.

After a long drive, I parked near the wall at Caw's Point, just north of Haltwhistle. The wall marked the frontier of the Roman Empire and extended from the west to east coasts across England. I walked along an intact section for about two miles before turning back. In the return journey I got caught out in the rain, stupidly without my rain jacket. The wind and rain picked up, and I was soaked. Then the wind shifted just enough to angle the rain across the wall, and I huddled next to the rocks for shelter. Strange to think I was using the wall in much the same way a Roman soldier might have done two millennia ago. After ten minutes beside the wall, the rain passed and the sun came out in full for the final half hour of sunset. I stood in its warming light while making my way over the hills back to the car. Never have I felt more connected to a monument, or to history. 

Back at the car, I changed into dry clothes and drove a short way off the main road until I found a roadside pull off where I spent the night. (I did a bit of aimless searching first, these spots aren't as easy to come across as I might make it sound. The ideal spot is away from lights and traffic, while not being so far out of the way. Many lots that would otherwise work have signs posted against overnight parking. Farm lanes tend to be reliable because they're naturally less trafficked and "passing places" are usually put in to allow cars to get around the larger farm vehicles/equipment.)

My last stop was what I had planned to do first. Driving east alongside the wall (or its ruins), I made my way back to the coast where I'd intended to start. I followed the same coastal route Sam and I had planned to do by bike, "Route 1: Coast and Castles." I suppose following that route was a bit cathartic, being the right blend of an experience I'd lost and the means of still achieving it. I continued along the coast then crossed to Holy Island, separated from the mainland by a mile-long tidal causeway. I spent a few hours wandering the island, taking in the stunning Lindisfarne Castle.

 I left the island before the tide flooded the road, and headed back toward Bamburgh to have dinner at the heartily recommended Castle Inn. While the meal was good, dinner for one just isn't something to write about. The restaurant didn't have wifi, so I knocked on the door of a B&B next door and asked to use theirs; the woman who answered the door (a guest staying at the house) laughed and helpfully obliged. I Skype'd  Phil to confirm flight and trip details, then headed out toward the country to find another campsite.

It worked out that I had one extra day to kill before Phil arrived. I drove a loose route toward Glasgow, crossing unexpectedly into Scotland in the border town of Coldstream. I spent the afternoon there and in a few other small towns before setting up an early camp outside Glasgow. I read for a few hours, set my alarm, and fell asleep. Some days are more exciting than others.

At 6:30 in the morning I drove toward Glasgow International Airport, got a couple coffees and waited for Phil. When he came through the doors, he smiled and gave me a big hug. I was happy to have someone with me on the trip again, even for just a weekend.

I didn't mention that I hadn't showered in ten days.
