title: A real wild camp and our first glimpse of the Alps
---
Yesterday we rode about 100km from [Martellago][1] to [Valdastico][2] before
setting up camp around 9 in the evening. Along the route we had noticed signs
forbidding camping in the region, so we were a bit worried when we saw two men
moving toward our campsite. With a mountain on one side and a river on the
other, we had had some difficulty finding a well-hidden site. With a mix of
Spanish and broken Italian we explained that we'd stay just one night.
"Tranquilo, tranquilo!" ("No problem!") the men responded with smiles, then
quickly and sincerely warned us about a "cinghiale." Eventually we managed the
translation: they were looking for a warthog that had been spotted in the area.
Sam and I exchanged glances, knowing that wild pigs really are dangerous. Not
long after, we heard a loud gunshot echo off the mountainside that sent our
nerves jangling.

Despite the unexpected action, we enjoyed a hearty dinner: penne with turkey
breast and grilled white onions. Good thing too, because the next morning we
pushed through the hardest climb of the trip. Winding through dozens of
switchbacks and hairpin turns, we made our way up past 1000m &mdash; some 800m
of climbing.

From the peak by [Carbonare][3], we raced back down through
freezing temperatures into the city of [Trento][4]. We stopped at the train
station to get tickets to our next destination, [ZÃ¼rich][5], Switzerland.
