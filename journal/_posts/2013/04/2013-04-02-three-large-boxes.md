title: Three large boxes

In my studio apartment was a couch, a bed, a dresser, and a table and
chairs. There were clothes hanging in the closet, was food on the shelves, were
pots and pans in the cupboards, and there was usually some music playing in the
background. It wasn't a big place, but it was my own. I had friends nearby and
some of my favorite places were around the corner. Work wasn't far away. This
was *my* place in Boston (well, Somerville anyway), and I'd become quite
accustomed to it. Now I had to fit everything in the place into a box and pack
that into a basement.

I'd sold my car the weekend before. I had owned that car nearly ten years and
was reluctant to let it go. In it I'd driven thousands of miles: to soccer games
in high school, to college in Indiana, to work in Boston, to hiking and skiing
in West Virginia. I can remember stopping on different nights on small roads in
the middle of nowhere between Ohio and Indiana; I would shut off the lights to
gaze up at the wide open sky, full of stars, and just stare. Between buying a
one-way ticket abroad, leaving my job, and ending my lease, I felt the most
strange handing over my car keys and walking home.

I gave the couch to some good friends. I left the dresser and table for the
person moving in after me. I donated a lot of my clothes. I still had more
stuff left over than I knew what to do with, lying around in piles on the floor.
I would grab a handful of things from one pile and move them to another,
shifting the weight of the room from one side to the other but not making any
progress. Eventually (and with a lot of help), I had packed all my things into
three large boxes which were carried into a basement and stored away.

Now all I had was a few outfits and a bike, and a notion to ride that bike
across as much of Europe as possible.
