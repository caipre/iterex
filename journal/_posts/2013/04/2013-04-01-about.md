This site is intended to be an archive of the thoughts and experiences of two
guys traveling by bike around Europe. Given the nature of this method of travel,
the site will likely be updated at irregular intervals; probably several days'
(or weeks') experiences will be added at the same time. There is [an RSS
feed][1] containing the 20 most recent items which provides some notification
for when new items are added.

Except the starting point, the route for the trip is wholly unmarked. The ride
will begin outside of [MÃ¡laga, Spain][2] and continue east and north along the
coast into France. Beyond that, the only other known destination is the UK,
since the [Schengen Agreement][3] enforces a Visa of three months for most of
the countries in mainland western Europe.

For both riders, this is the first tour of significant length. The challenge of
the unknown is the primary impetus for such an adventure.
