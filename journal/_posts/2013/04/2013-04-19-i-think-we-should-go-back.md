title: I think we should go back.
---
When we left this morning it was the first time riding loaded with full bags and
gear. We probably should have planned that better... We laughed while adjusting
to the new weight and tried our best not to worry about how it would feel to
ride uphill with an additional 30+ pounds. Before, the bikes had felt quick and
nimble, as if they were cutting through the wind. Now it felt like riding an
elephant or driving a long train: slow to start, hard to stop, and with wide
turns. The difference was more than I had anticipated.

After about 20km, we decided that it would symbolic to dip our tires into the
Mediterranean since we'd be following the coast for much of the trip.

While on the beach, Sam remembered that we'd forgotten to copy [Departures][1]
onto the computer. Departures is an awesome show about two Canadian guys who
spent a few years traveling all over the world. We decided that it was worth it
to go back, so we rode the 20km (and all the hills they contained) back home and
arrived just in time for lunch.

After eating, we wiped down the bikes one last time then set out again about
5:00. The hills seemed easier the second time around, and we were already
familiar with the roads from having ridden them unloaded. For our first night on
the road we wanted to give ourselves the comfort of an actual campground, and we
found one outside of a town named Carchuna de Motril. We rolled into Don Cactus
campground just before sundown, having covered about 86km for the day (only half
of which was actual progress). And we were smiling the whole way.
