title: I think we should go back.
---
When we left this morning it was the first time riding loaded with full bags and
gear. We probably should have planned that better... We laughed while adjusting
to the new weight and tried our best not to worry about how it would feel to
ride uphill with an additional 30+ pounds. Before, the bikes had felt quick and
nimble, as if we were cutting through the wind. Now it was like riding an
elephant or driving a train: slow to start, hard to stop, and with wide turns.

After about 20km, we decided that, since we'd be following the coast for much of
the trip, it would symbolic to dip our tires into the Mediterranean.  While on
the beach, Sam remembered that we'd forgotten to copy [Departures][1] onto the
computer. Departures is an awesome show about two Canadian guys who spent a few
years traveling all over the world. We decided that it was worth it to go back,
so we rode the 20km (and all the hills they contained) back home and arrived
just in time for lunch.

After eating, we wiped down the bikes one last time then set out again about
5:00. The hills seemed easier the second time around, and we were already
familiar with the roads from having ridden them unloaded. For our first night on
the road we wanted to give ourselves the comfort of an actual campground, and we
found one outside of Carchuna de Motril. We rolled into Don Cactus just before
sundown, having covered about 86km for the day, only half of which was actual
progress.

And we were smiling the whole way.
