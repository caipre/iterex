title: Your flight has been canceled
---
When I bought my bike last July, they told me to bring it back in for a tune up
after about 500 miles. Now it was April, and I doubted that there were any more
than 100 miles on it. I had ridden to work a few times over the summer (always
showing up later and sweatier than I'd have liked), and twice with friends
around the Boston area. Then came my first real New England winter and the bike
was stuck leaning against a wall inside my studio while the snow piled up.

"It didn't need much," the bike mechanic confirmed that I hadn't worked the bike
hard enough to justify the tune up. This was a shop that specialized in top of
the line racing bikes, and I felt out of place for having little riding
experience while planning an extended tour. The guys in the shop swapped focus
between mild interest in my trip and the more pressing issue of fitting a
tubeless tire onto a wheel. I asked a few questions about routine maintenance,
then we disassembled the bike to fit it into a box so I could check it with me
on the plane.

Before the bike was packed, my phone vibrated from a text message. The message
was from British Airways and said simply: "Your flight has been canceled." There
was a number to call for questions. I stood still for a moment &mdash; the past
few days had been a mess of tying up loose ends at work, packing or selling most
of the things I owned, and avoiding thoughts of leaving my friends and family.
It was finally the day of the flight and this change caught me off my guard. I
immediately regretted having bought the flight through an iffy online company
that I knew would have no customer support. I stepped out of the bike shop to
figure out what had happened and what was going to happen.

After a short conversation with a British Airways attendant, I accepted one of
the nine remaining seats on an flight leaving two hours earlier than my original
booking; my connecting flight to Spain would be the same. Sam's booking had
been changed as well. He was supposed to fly from Chicago to Boston so we
could continue to Spain together, but his ticket was changed to a direct flight
into London with different connecting flight to Spain. We'd have to wait until
we were both in Málaga before we would see each other.

I left the bike shop feeling quite a bit more rushed than when I had entered. A
few short hours later, I was at Logan airport saying some hard goodbyes. It felt
like I would be leaving Boston for a lot longer than the five months I was
planning.

While waiting to board, I sent out some final goodbyes before turning off my
phone.  I slept for most of the flight across the Atlantic. When I landed in
London Heathrow, the sky was overcast gray and it was snowing. It reminded me of
a perfectly named drink I used to get at the coffee house at university: a
London Fog. I hoped it would be warmer by the time we made it back here on bike.
I left Heathrow on a bus to Gattwick, about an hour ride. After a short flight
to Málaga, I landed in sunny Spain where I was greeted by Sam and his family.

We'd made it.
